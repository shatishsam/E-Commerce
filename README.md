## Getting Started

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To develop a project in React, first we have to download and install node js on our local machine. Furthermore, we have install npx plugins in our node folder.

List of Required Softwares and Plugins:

1.  Node JS (environment)

2.  NPX plugins

3.  JavaScript (Programming language)

4.  React JS: Package

List of Dependencies:

1. React-router-dom

2. React-icons

3. emotion

4. material-ui (mui)

5. bootstrap

6. react-icons

8. typescript

### Installing

First install all the required softwares.

1.  Download the Node js on our local machine.

2.  Install it and open any editor.(I have used Visual Studio Code)

3.  Then check whether the node is install or not by using node --v command'.

4.  After that choose specific folder where we have to create a application.

5.  Then create a react application withcommand: npx create-react-app PROJECT-GROUP5

### Clone and run

1. Get the code base from gitlab, the link provided at the begining of the file.
2. Copy the https link of the repo and use `git clone <COPIED_LINK>`. This will index the code base that is stored on the gitlab repo.
3. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`.
4. In the same directory, use `npm run dev` to start the local deamon for the site.
5. If all the step are followed correctly the browser will automatically launch a new tab with an address of `localhost:3000`.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. You may also include a quick example of what the marker should see if the installation of all required software / libraries / plug-ins was successful.

## Deployment

- For deployment we have used [Surge](https://surge.sh/) which will help to host our application.

- At first we have pushed individual features to the gitlab repo at our individual branch.

- We added merge request to all the features. Merged them with review by team members.

- After getting the codebase on the the main branch we tested it in our local environment.

- Then we moved to [Surge](https://surge.sh/) for deployment.
